NETWORKING NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION


The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on a nomaly-based and 
misusebased detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based detection is generally 
favored in commercial products  due to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research 
anomaly detection is typically conceived as a more   powerful method  due to its theoretical 
potential for addressing novel attacks


detect anamolies and attacks in the 
network.  There are two problems. 
1.  Binomial Classification: Activity is normal or attack
2.  Multinomial classification: Activity is normal or DOS or PROBE or R2L or U2R
